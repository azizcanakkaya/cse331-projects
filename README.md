# cse331-projects
Series of projects that executed through out the course of Computer Organization.

##Project 1
This project covers recursive backtracking and its' implementation to MIPS Assembly

##Project 2
The digital design of this circuit has a finite state machine that covers a multiplication logic algorithm

##Project 3
Project 3 is based on a MIPS arcitechture we design with custom instructions. Note that the project has its' unit implemented but they did not tested as a whole unit.
